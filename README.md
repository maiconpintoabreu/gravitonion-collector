Player needs to protect the BackHole from the asteroids so it does not go too big and stay close from it so the scientists are able to collect information of it.


## TODO:
* Move the start position to the middle left to avoid straigth dying from the asteroids
* Start game only when player gives the first instruction
* Phaser shader to ondulate it
* UI to show the power (with power mechanics)
* UI to toogle UI controller
* UI to Pause
* Add power ups (gun modifier and temp shield dropped by the asteroids) 

## Known bugs
* Some bullets are passing the phaser
* Some bullets are not hitting the asteroid even when they pass on the top

### Maybes:
* Blackhole could do some random pulses to increase the gravity
* Start menu
* Frendly fire when player shoots the blackhole it increases in size as well
* local multiplayer (half score and increase in difficult)
