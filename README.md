Player needs to protect the BackHole from the asteroids so it does not go too big and stay close from it so the scientists are able to collect information of it.


## TODO:
* When the black hole grows more than some value it will beam later around.
* If the player flies close to the black hole it will rechange the power and get better multiplier.
* UI to show the power (with power mechanics)
* UI to toogle UI controller
* UI to Pause
* Add Gameover if the player touchs the blackhole or one of the asteroids
* Increase difficulty by time (increase gravity, number of asteroids per second)
* Add power ups (gun modifier and temp shield dropped by the asteroids) 

### Maybes:
* Blackhole could do some random pulses to increase the gravity
* Start menu
* Frendly fire when player shoots the blackhole it increases in size as well
* local multiplayer (half score and increase in difficult)
